Building in public means sharing your process, not just the polished result. It is a commitment to transparency that accelerates learning, invites collaboration, and builds trust with an audience over time. This post explains why I do it and how you can start.

## Key points

- Sharing work-in-progress forces clarity of thought
- Feedback loops shorten when you build in the open
- Imperfection is a feature, not a bug

## The case for transparency

Most creators wait until something is finished before they show it to the world. That instinct is understandable — nobody wants to be judged on a half-built thing. But waiting has a cost.

When you keep your work hidden, you lose the chance for **early feedback**. You lose the accountability that comes from saying *"I'm working on this"* where others can see. And you lose the compounding benefit of documenting your journey as it happens.

> The best time to share your work is before you think it's ready.

## How to start

Starting is simpler than it sounds:

1. Pick a project you care about
2. Write a short update every time you make progress
3. Publish it somewhere — a blog, a social post, a note

The format does not matter. What matters is the habit of **reflecting and sharing** as you go.

## A practical example

Here is a tiny script that logs today's date — the kind of small thing you might share while learning:

```javascript
const today = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
});
console.log(`Today is ${today}`);
```

Nothing groundbreaking, but sharing it signals that you are learning, building, and moving forward.

Building in public is not about performance. It is about practice. Start small, stay consistent, and watch what happens.
