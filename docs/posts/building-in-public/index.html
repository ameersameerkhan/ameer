    <p>Building in public means sharing your process, not just the polished result. It is a commitment to transparency that accelerates learning, invites collaboration, and builds trust with an audience over time. This post explains why I do it and how you can start.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul><li>Sharing work-in-progress forces clarity of thought</li>
<li>Feedback loops shorten when you build in the open</li>
<li>Imperfection is a feature, not a bug</li></ul>
<h2>The case for transparency</h2>
<p>Most creators wait until something is finished before they show it to the world. That instinct is understandable — nobody wants to be judged on a half-built thing. But waiting has a cost.</p>
<p>When you keep your work hidden, you lose the chance for <strong>early feedback</strong>. You lose the accountability that comes from saying <em>&quot;I'm working on this&quot;</em> where others can see. And you lose the compounding benefit of documenting your journey as it happens.</p>
<blockquote><p>The best time to share your work is before you think it's ready.</p></blockquote>
<h2>How to start</h2>
<p>Starting is simpler than it sounds:</p>
<ol><li>Pick a project you care about</li>
<li>Write a short update every time you make progress</li>
<li>Publish it somewhere — a blog, a social post, a note</li></ol>
<p>The format does not matter. What matters is the habit of <strong>reflecting and sharing</strong> as you go.</p>
<h2>A practical example</h2>
<p>Here is a tiny script that logs today's date — the kind of small thing you might share while learning:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">const today = new Date().toLocaleDateString('en-US', {
  year: 'numeric',
  month: 'long',
  day: 'numeric',
});
console.log(`Today is ${today}`);</code></pre>
<p>Nothing groundbreaking, but sharing it signals that you are learning, building, and moving forward.</p>
<hr>
<p>Building in public is not about performance. It is about practice. Start small, stay consistent, and watch what happens.</p>
