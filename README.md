My personal website. Writing about thinking, building, and learning in public.

## Why this exists

I spend most of my time inside Cursor now. Rather than paying for a platform and accepting the lock-in, algorithmic uncertainty, AND subscription costs that come with it — I decided to build a simple site that lives right here alongside my work.

It's a static site. No framework, no CMS, no dependencies. Just a Node script that turns Markdown into HTML pages. Hosted on GitHub Pages with a custom domain.

**The tradeoffs are real and I'm fine with them:**
- No built-in audience or distribution — I have to bring my own
- No comments, analytics dashboard, or social features out of the box
- Publishing means a git push, not clicking a button

But what I get back matters more: full ownership, zero platform risk, no monthly bill, and a writing environment that's two keystrokes away from where I already am.

Everything is optimised for the production of quality thought and for readability.

## The site

**Live at:** [heyameer.com](https://heyameer.com)

Static HTML, CSS, vanilla JS. Zero dependencies. Built with `node scripts/build.mjs` and served from the `docs/` folder via GitHub Pages.

## License

The site code, templates, and build tooling are open for reuse — take them as a starting point for your own site.
