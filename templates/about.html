    I'm Ameer — a thinker, builder, and perpetual learner. This site is where I write
    about the things that occupy my mind: technology, design, strategy, and the craft
    of building things that matter.

    I believe in working in public, learning by doing, and sharing ideas before they're
    perfect. If something here resonates, I'd love to hear from you.
